FireMonkey support (XE2, XE3, XE4, XE5) - thanks to Frediano Palazzi for financially supporting this modification.

TDelphiTwain is not a TComponent descendand any more - you have to use it from code only and free it by yourself.

For FireMonkey add DelphiTwain and DelphiTwain_FMX units to the uses clause. 
For VCL add DelphiTwain and DelphiTwain_VCL to the uses clause.
